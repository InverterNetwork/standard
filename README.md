# Inverter Standard

The Inverter Standard is a comprehensive set of guidelines for developing software within the Inverter Network. This standard aims to ensure consistent code quality, security, and maintainability across all projects. While initially focused on Solidity smart contracts, these standards provide a foundation for all future development work across different technologies.

## Code Standard
The Inverter Code Standard provides universal guidelines for writing code across the Inverter Network ecosystem. It is designed to ensure that all code is written in a way that is easy to understand, easy to maintain, and easy to extend.

### Universal Standards
The main code standard contains principles and guidelines applicable to all Inverter Network repositories:
- **[Inverter Code Standard](./code/README.md)** - Universal standards for naming conventions, code layout, testing, documentation, and development workflow

### Repository-Specific Extensions
For projects with specific architectural patterns, additional guidelines are available:
- **[Repository-Specific Extensions](./code/REPOSITORY_SPECIFIC_EXTENSIONS.md)** - Detailed folder structures, module-specific naming conventions, and specialized patterns that can be copied into individual repositories as needed

### Usage
1. **All Projects**: Follow the universal standards in the main code standard
2. **Specific Project Types**: Copy relevant sections from the extensions file into your project's documentation
3. **Custom Adaptations**: Adapt the universal principles to your project's specific needs while maintaining consistency

## Security Standard
The Inverter Security Standard is a set of guidelines and best practices for building a secure software stack. It is designed to ensure that all code is written in a way that is secure and resistant to attack.
