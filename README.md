# Inverter Standard

The Inverter Standard is a comprehensive set of guidelines for developing software within the Inverter Network. This standard aims to ensure consistent code quality, security, and maintainability across all projects. For now, it is focused on Solidity smart contracts, but will be expanded to cover all aspects of development in the future.

## Code Standard
The Inverter Code Standard is a set of guidelines for writing code for the Inverter Network. It is designed to ensure that all code is written in a way that is easy to understand, easy to maintain, and easy to extend.
